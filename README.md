# Intermediate Python Programming

## Summary of intermediate-level topics for Python programming:

1. Data types: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings
2. Collections: specialized data structures like named tuples, deque, counter, and defaultdict
3. Itertools: functions that work with iterable data types to create efficient iterators
4. Lambda functions: anonymous functions that can take any number of arguments and return a single value
5. Exceptions and Errors: how to handle unexpected events or errors that occur during program execution
6. Logging: techniques for logging program output and error messages
7. JSON: working with JSON data using the built-in json module
8. Random numbers: generating random numbers for various use cases
9. Decorators: modifying or enhancing the functionality of existing functions using decorators
10. Generators: creating iterable sequences using generator functions
11. Threading vs Multiprocessing: understanding the difference between these two techniques for running multiple tasks simultaneously
12. Multithreading: using threads to execute multiple tasks concurrently within a single program
13. Multiprocessing: running multiple processes in parallel to increase program performance
14. Function Arguments: how to pass arguments to functions and work with default arguments, keyword arguments, and variable-length argument lists
15. Shallow vs Deep Copying: understanding the difference between these two techniques for copying objects in Python
16. Context Managers: using the "with" statement to manage resources and ensure proper clean-up of objects after use.
